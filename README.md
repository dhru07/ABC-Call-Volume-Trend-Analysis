# ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis

## Project Overview

The **ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis** project focuses on analyzing inbound call data to provide actionable insights aimed at optimizing customer service operations. This project explores call volume trends, average call durations, and identifies patterns to enhance customer experience by reducing call abandonment and improving manpower allocation, particularly for night shifts.

## Project Objectives

- **Call Volume Analysis**: Identify patterns and trends in inbound call volume over different time intervals.
- **Average Call Duration Analysis**: Analyze call durations to understand service efficiency and potential areas for improvement.
- **Call Volume Visualization**: Present call data visually to help make informed decisions.
- **Manpower Planning**: Recommend effective manpower distribution for handling peak call times and minimizing abandonment rates.
- **Night Shift Optimization**: Provide suggestions on allocating resources for the night shift to maintain efficient customer service.

## Technologies Used

- **Excel**: Data cleaning, statistical analysis, and exploration.
- **Power BI**: For advanced visualizations and dashboard creation (if applicable).
- **Python/SQL**: For data manipulation and advanced analysis (optional, if used).
- **Statistical Analysis**: To understand call volume patterns, forecast, and identify outliers.

## Data

The dataset consists of inbound call logs, capturing key performance metrics like timestamps, call durations, and outcomes.

### Dataset Columns

- `Call ID`: Unique identifier for each call.
- `Timestamp`: Date and time of the inbound call.
- `Call Duration`: Duration of the call in seconds.
- `Customer ID`: Identifier for the customer calling.
- `Call Outcome`: Status or result of the call (e.g., completed, abandoned).
- Additional columns such as call type, region, agent ID, etc. (if available).

## Key Insights

- **Call Volume Trends**: Insights on peak call volumes and time-of-day trends.
- **Call Duration Analysis**: Average call durations and their impact on customer satisfaction.
- **Manpower Needs**: Recommendations for staffing during peak periods.
- **Night Shift Recommendations**: Insights into effective night shift manpower allocation to reduce abandonment.

## Deliverables

- **Analysis Report (PDF/PPT)**: A detailed report including insights and recommendations based on the data analysis.
- **Data Visualizations**: Graphs, charts, and dashboards illustrating key trends and findings.
- **Video Presentation**: A short video summarizing the analysis and actionable insights.
